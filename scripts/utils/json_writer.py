"""Biome-compliant JSON writer for generator output.

Super-Linter's BIOME_FORMAT check runs on every `pull_request` to main,
and the release pipeline force-adds auto-generated JSON under
`docs/specifications/api/` and `docs/api-reference/` into its commits.
Generator output must therefore already match what Biome would produce,
otherwise Super-Linter fails and the release PR cannot auto-merge.

This helper is the single source of truth for writing such files. It
fails loudly if Biome is missing (or fails) so the pipeline never
silently emits non-compliant output.
